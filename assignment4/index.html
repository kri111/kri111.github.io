		<h1> The Future of Apple's MacBooks </h1>
		<h2> Merging iOS and macOS </h2>
			<p>
				For years, many have speculated that iOS and macOS will merge for a more "seamless" experience across Apple's
				ecosystem and devices. But this won't happen. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, mentioned that merging iOS and macOS
				would comprise on some aspects for both operating systems and they both are great for different use cases.
				He mentioned that he has no plans of making Apple merge the two operating systems, although both will borrow
				appropriate features from each other.
			</p>
		<h2> The next step for iOS and macOS </h2>
			<p>
				Phil Schiller, Apple's SVP of Worldwide Marketing, mentioned that a major Mac App Store redesign is coming
				like the one we saw in iOS 11 and he assured Mac customers that they have not been forgotten. Current speculations
				suggest the next versions of iOS and macOS will include "universal apps" where a developer submits one app
				and that app can be run on both -- macOS and iOS. This is a big deal because it'll make Apple's ecosystem even
				tighter and it also naturally brings up the concerns of compiling these apps for ARM (Apple's A-chip series) and
				Intel (for all their Macs) processors which have drastically different architectures. If Apple can manage to make univesal apps big, they'll have a huge advantage over
				the industry and the Mac App Store will become far more notable and important in Apple's vision for desktop
				computing moving forward. With this model, if implemented correctly, both platforms become stronger and
				better integrated within the ecosystem while they also getting to keep their own strengths (iOS or macOS won'
				have to comprise in any way as Tim Cook suggested completely merging the to operating systems would).
			</p>
		<h2> The next step in hardware </h2>
			<p>
				The  Apple designed A11 Bionic chip powering the new iPhones are incredibly fast and far ahead of the industry in performance.
				They have benchmark scores considerably higher than the MacBook and even higher than the base MacBook Pro and some mid-tier
				MacBook Pros.

				Naturally, if Apple's silicon team is so far ahead, then why don't they put their own chips into their MacBook Pros or at least
				their ultra-portable but underpowered MacBooks? This seems like a common-sense move. This would save them lots of money and also
				decrease their reliance on Intel. Additionally, the A-series chips in the iPhones and ARM chips in general are far better at
				power management, connectivity, and always-on functionalities. Microsoft realized this and they're working alongside
				Qualcomm to bring the Snapdragon smartphone processors to Windows laptops and we can already see the results. Battery life on
				these Windows machines have increased from 10 hours to an astonishing 20 hours of use, the laptops have the smartphone instant-on
				capabilities when waking from sleep mode, and they're also LTE connected! However, since the processor architecture is different,
				Microsoft had to recompile Windows 10 to support ARM instead of Intel's x86-64 architecture. So, most applications don't work and much
				of Windows becomes a broken experience.
			</p>
		<h2> Conclusion </h2>
			<p>
				Apple doesn't want to downgrade and comprimise its experience in any way so they haven't yet
				put their A11 Bionic chips in their MacBooks. When they begin accepting universal apps in the iOS
				and Mac App Stores, they will most likely create an under-the-hood mechanism in Xcode where it creates
				a build for Intel processors to run that app on Macs as well as an ARM version to run that same app on
				iPhones and iPads and even Apple Watches. Apple will most likely begin the ARM processor transition for their
				Macs starting with the MacBook -- a laptop aimed at general consumers for light-weight activities. The MacBook
				will be able to run many apps, have faster performance with far greater battery life, always-on and always-connected
				functionalities like a smartphone, and it will be integrated even more tightly within Apple's ecosytem. Over the
				next few years, they would most likely extend the A-series chip to the rest of the laptop line and possibly even to
				their desktop line one day. As soon as we see universal apps becoming a thing (most likely this summer), we can
				soon begin to expect Apple to begin their transition from Intel to their own ARM chips in their laptops. With this slow
				and tactful transition, they wouldn't be comprising on the user-experience anywhere while gaining all the advantages
				that ARM processors have to offer.
