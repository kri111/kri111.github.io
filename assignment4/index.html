		<h1> The Future of Apple's MacBooks </h1>
		<h2> Merging iOS and macOS </h2>
			<p>
				For years, many have speculated that iOS and macOS will merge for a more "seamless" experience across Apple's
				ecosystem and devices. But this won't happen. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, mentioned that merging iOS and macOS
				would comprise on some aspects for both operating systems and they both are great for different use cases.
				He mentioned that he has no plans of making Apple merge the two operating systems, although both will borrow
				appropriate features from each other.
			</p>
		<h2> The next step for iOS and macOS </h2>
			<p>
				Phil Schiller, Apple's SVP of Worldwide Marketing, mentioned that a major Mac App Store redesign is coming
				like the one we saw in iOS 11 and he assured Mac customers that they have not been forgotten. Current speculations
				suggest the next versions of iOS and macOS will include "universal apps" where a developer submits one app
				and that app can be run on both -- macOS and iOS. This is a big deal because it'll make Apple's ecosystem even
				tighter and it also naturally brings up the concerns of compiling these apps for ARM (Apple's A-chip series) and
				Intel (for all their Macs) processors which have drastically different architectures. If Apple can manage to make univesal apps big, they'll have a huge advantage over
				the industry and the Mac App Store will become far more notable and important in Apple's vision for desktop
				computing moving forward. With this model, if implemented correctly, both platforms become stronger and
				better integrated within the ecosystem while they also getting to keep their own strengths (iOS or macOS won'
				have to comprise in any way as Tim Cook suggested completely merging the to operating systems would).
			</p>
		<h2> The next step in hardware </h2>
			<p>
				The  Apple designed A11 Bionic chip powering the new iPhones are incredibly fast and far ahead of the industry in performance.
				They benchmark scores considerably higher than the MacBook and even higher than the base MacBook Pro and some mid-tier
				MacBook Pros.
